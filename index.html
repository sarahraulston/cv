      <p><em>Learning How to Code:<strong> I'm Ready to Make A Lot of Money</strong></em></p>
      <p>Hi, my name is Sarah. I am currently managing a restaurant. I like managing,
        and I love the people, but I want to make money and have time.
        I want to make enough money, have all the time, and with good health and
        good friends, I want to experience life without worry.
        I want to travel with luxury and style, buy handmade quality items,
        eat rich delicious food, and secure eveything deserved and destined
        for myself and my loved ones. I want to be content and balanced. I want
        to be able to do the things I want to do. I am starting somewhere.
        I am starting with coding. Putting in work to see if it will pay off.
        I think it will.</p></td>
